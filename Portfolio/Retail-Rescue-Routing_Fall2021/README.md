# Retail-Rescue-Routing
This was a project in my Operations Management course where myself and 3 other students worked with the Great Plains Food Bank in Fargo, ND to optimize vehicle routing for their Retail Rescue initiative. This initiative involves truck drivers traveling to various businesses in the area that would donate food or other products to be dropped off at agencies in the area that specialized in getting these donations to those in need. Our goal was to build a program that could take input in the form of different locations and a range of time that they were open as well as historical data on how much they typically donate and determine the optimal route for drivers to take to minimize drive time while also ensuring the trucks didn't go over capacity. The program that exported the generated routes into a readable spreadsheet. 

At the beginning of the project we intended to make use of a routing API developed by Google to generate the routes. We discovered relatively late in the project that the API was not as flexible as we initially thought and could not be modified to account for some of our more specific constraints. Because of this, we had to pivot and start from the ground up. Due to our limited time remaining we opted to employ a more brute force method of determining the optimal routes.
