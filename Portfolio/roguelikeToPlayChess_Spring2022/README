This is a project developed for my undergraduate capstone project during my Junior year of college. The project was a twist on the game of chess which added a shop, over 30 custom pieces with unique effects, and elements of the rogue-like genre. The game also included an asynchrounous player versus player system by saving each player's chess board at the beginning of each round to a database. Player's would then face a computer using a randomly selected board from a past player.
