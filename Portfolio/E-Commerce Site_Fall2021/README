This is a fake E-Commerce site created for my intro to web development course my Junior year of my undergraduate. The project was a group project with my main contributions being the front-end of the site (primarily the main landing page). Since this was made during an intro course, the professor wanted us to make things manually from the ground up instead of utilizing prebuilt libraries and frameworks.
